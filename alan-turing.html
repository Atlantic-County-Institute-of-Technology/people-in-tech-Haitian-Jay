    <p>
    Alan Turing was born on June 23rd, 1912 in London England and died on June 7th, 1954 in Wilmslow Cheshire. Alan was a British mathematician and logician who made major contributions to many different fields of work such as math, cryptanalysis, logic, philosophy, and mathematical biology. He also made contributions to new areas such as computer science, cognitive science, AI, and artificial life.

    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p>
        Turing went to school at a top private school because he was the son of a civil servant. He went to the University of Cambridge to study math in 1931 and he graduated in 1934, afterwards he was elected to a fellowship at King's College because of his research in probability theory. In 1936 Turing's paper "On Computable Numbers, with an Appication to the <i>Entscheidungsproblem</i>(Decision Problem)" was recommended to be published by the American math logician Alonzo Church. He later on when to Princeton University to study for a Ph.D. in mathematical logic under Church's direction.
